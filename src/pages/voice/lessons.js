                        As a voice teacher, I believe deeply that students flourish with a teacher who balances their expectations with the individual needs of each student. A voice student needs to feel that their teacher sees them as an individual and truly believes they can do the things they are being asked to do. I work very hard to meet each of my students exactly where they are-- in technique, in practice expectations, and in focus.
                    </p>
                    <p> I accept dedicated students over the age of 10. </p>
